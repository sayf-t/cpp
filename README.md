# Learn C++ Through Bitcoin-Focused Projects

Welcome to this hands-on C++ learning curriculum! This course is designed to teach you C++ fundamentals through building real Bitcoin components. You'll learn by doing, creating actual cryptocurrency tools and understanding how Bitcoin Core works.

## What You'll Build 🚀

Throughout this course, you'll create:
- Cryptographic tools used in Bitcoin
- Transaction handling systems
- Blockchain data structures
- Network communication tools
- And much more!

Each project connects directly to real Bitcoin Core functionality, teaching you both C++ and cryptocurrency development.
